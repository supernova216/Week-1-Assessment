// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step, where user expectations for the new software are defined"
const design = "This is the third step, where the user expectations are converted into a form that can be implemented by a programming language"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where the software is integrated into the company's systems and workflows"
const testing = "This is the fifth step, where the software is assessed for performance and checked for bugs"
const maitain = "This is the final step, where the software is modified and updated to account for any glitches or issues that pop up after shipping the software"
